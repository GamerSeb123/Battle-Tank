# Battle Tank

This is a head to head open world tank war game. 

## Game Design Document

* Concept 
This is a tank warfare game. There will be you 'The Player' vs a number of enemies. Survive to win and use the terrain to get a tactical advantage. 

* Rules 
You win the game by getting the maximum score or by having the most amount of points before the time runs out. You only have a finite amount of health and ammo, so be wise with your shots. 

* Requirements 
Sound effects of movement of the barrel, tracks, missiles and explosions. Need a mesh of the tank to include tracks, body, turret and barrel. Need to have visual effects for the explosions and smoke. Use shaders and good textures to make the game look as good as it can for the set style.
